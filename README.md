## üõ†Ô∏è Design

- **Component-Driven:**  
  Every UI element is a reusable, modular React component, making the codebase easy to maintain and extend.

- **Global CSS Variables:**  
  Colors, spacing, and typography are managed with CSS variables for consistent theming and easy tweaks.

- **Semantic HTML:**  
  Uses `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, and `<button>` for accessibility and SEO.

- **Animations with Framer Motion:**  
  All window transitions and popovers use Framer Motion for a modern, smooth feel.
