# 🐧 Custom-Riced Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive developer portfolio! This isn't your standard vertical-scrolling site. I've built a **Unix-inspired, tiling window manager environment** right in the browser. It's a tribute to the "riced" Linux setups I love, blending heavy functionality with a clean, professional aesthetic.

## 🚀 The Vision

I wanted to build something that reflects how I actually work. This portfolio simulates a desktop environment where you can open multiple apps, tile them to your liking, and interact with a functional system.

### Why this is cool:
- **Master-Stack Tiling:** Just like a real WM (dwm, i3, or hyprland), windows resize smartly as you open and close them.
- **"Riced" to Perfection:** Built entirely around the **Nord** color palette for that premium, low-eye-strain developer feel.
- **Interactive Terminal:** It's not just for show. It has a virtual filesystem, syntax highlighting, and even tab-completion.

## ✨ Features that Pop

### 📂 Advanced Projects Explorer
Forget simple lists. Browse my work through a **modern Linux file manager**. 
- **Interactive Previews:** Hover over any project file to get a "peek" at the screenshot and the tech stack used.
- **Categorized Browsing:** Projects are organized into Web, Data Science, and Database directories.

### 💻 High-Performance Terminal
A fully-featured terminal emulator designed to feel like a **p10k-riced zsh shell**.
- **Neofetch Startup:** Get the system specs (and a cool ASCII penguin) the moment you open it.
- **Smart Syntax:** Real-time feedback turns commands green or red as you type.
- **Efficiency:** Supports `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `pwd`, and `clear` with full **Tab-Completion** support.

### ⚓ Desktop UX
- **Dynamic Dock:** Launch apps with smooth, stable animations.
- **System TopBar:** Quick access to system info and interactive popovers.
